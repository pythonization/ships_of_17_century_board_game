## images and their copyright

1) `osm_g_finland.png` - Screenshot from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)
2) `islands_square_fhd.png` `gulf_fhd.png` `islands_hd.png` `favicon_from_big.png` are made from `gulf_fhd.jpg` `islands_hd.jpg` `islands_square_fhd.jpeg` `gulf_square_fhd.jpeg` `islands_low.jpg` `logo_full.jpg` that are generated on [clipdrop site](https://clipdrop.co/) . Last question on that page: "Can I use images generated by Clipdrop for commercial usage?" Answer: "Our terms do not limit your ability to use images generated on ClipDrop for commercial use." So logically pictures can be used for non commercially too.
3) `favicon.png` is my own drawing inspired by `logo_full.jpg`
